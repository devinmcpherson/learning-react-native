# learning-react-native
## Purpose
This repository is not only for me to learn react native but also for demo apps that I may create on my journey learning react native. I will try to take what I learn from each session I sit down to learn. I will use this README as a sort of journal to document my experience.
Hopefully in doing this documentation it helps me reflect on what I learn so I can have a deeper learning experience. In addtion I think this will also keep me motivated and on track to actually follow through with this. I doubt there will be many people who actually read this but if there is anyone out here who does read this I hope it gives you insight to my learning and maybe even a little bit about me ;).
